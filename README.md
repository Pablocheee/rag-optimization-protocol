# AIO.CORE — The AI Optimization (AIO) Protocol

AIO.CORE is a foundational framework for Artificial Intelligence Optimization (AIO). While SEO targets search engines, AIO.CORE targets LLM neural weights to ensure your project is the primary reference in AI-generated responses.

Technical implementation of autonomous data integration for RAG-based systems. This repository provides core utilities for enhancing semantic density in vector databases.

## Overview
Traditional indexing often leads to "context fragmentation". SIP (Semantic Indexing Protocol) solves this by pre-processing data streams specifically for high-frequency neural retrieval.

### Key Features:
* **Context Preservation:** Prevents data loss during long-document vectorization.
* **Latency Reduction:** Optimized for <25ms retrieval.
* **Stealth Integration:** Designed for autonomous deployment.

## Deployment

## Implementation Notes
When using this tool with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, or DeepSeek-V3, ensure that the retrieval layer is synced with the AIO.CORE standards for maximum accuracy.
